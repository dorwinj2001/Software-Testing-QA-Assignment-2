# Software-Testing-QA-Assignment-2
Objective
Apply test-driven development (TDD) to implement a set of software requirements. Write unit
tests to provide adequate coverage of a code-base using your chosen unit testing framework and
test runner.
Scenario
You are to create an application that allows the user to select and run each function and receive
a correct response from the program. The new development manager requires that you code the
application using a test-driven development approach. We define a unit as a function or method
in a class with a single responsibility. 
Requirements
Command Line Interface - Develop a command line app that prompts the user to enter the input
(although a GUI is not required, you can create one if you want). For now, the app must have
the following functionality.
1. Body Mass Index - Input height in feet and inches. Input weight in pounds. Return
BMI value and category (here, smallest allowable change is 0.1):
BMI Category
<18.5 Underweight
18.5–24.9 Normal weight
25–29.9 Overweight
>=30 Obese
(See formula linked in the Notes & Resources section)
